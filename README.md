Project Name:
cardCollector

Description:
Because you can't always haul your entire card collection with you 
  everywhere you go, this application will allow users to input their 
  Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards into a database to have digital 
  representations of their collection at their fingertips.

Stack: 
JavaScript


Feature List:
-Add cards to a database
-View all cards in the database
-View individual card details
-Update cards that exist in the database
-Remove cards from the database



GitHub repo link:

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn:
-Become more experienced with GitHub
-Login & Reg with JavaScript



Product backlog:

-Additional Card Types: I'm going to begin with only 3 of the 7 primary card types (no disrespect to 'Battle' but I'm not including it due to it being introduced this year).
 I wanted to include all 7 primary card types, but minimum viable product and all.

-Search feature: while I'm going to start small by only allowing users to navigate to a specific card's details via a list, 
  I want to add a search field that allows users to input text and choose search type from a dropdown menu (e.g. card name, keyword ability, card body text)

-Creating decks: Users will be able to do full CRUD with custom card decks.

-API support: I'd love to build an API that literally has data for
  every MTG card ever made, so users instead search for the title of a card,
  and the API retrieves name matches.

-Allow users to add photos of card artwork.

-Social aspect: Allow users to add their friends on the app and compare 
  collections, deck lists, maybe even propose trades, etc.
