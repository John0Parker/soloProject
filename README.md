Project Name:
cardCollector

Description:
Because you can't always haul your entire card collection with you 
  everywhere you go, this application will allow users to input their 
  Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards into a database to have digital 
  representations of their collection at their fingertips.

Stack: 
JavaScript


Feature List:
-Add cards to a database
-View all cards in the database
-View individual card details
-Update cards that exist in the database
-Remove cards from the database

Product backlog:
-Search feature: while I'm going to start small by only allowing users to navigate to a specific card's details via a list, 
  I want to add a search field that allows users to input text and choose search type from a dropdown menu (e.g. card name, keyword ability, card body text)

-Creating decks: Users will be able to do full CRUD with custom card decks.

-API support: I'd love to build an API that literally has data for
  every MTG card ever made, so users instead search for the title of a card,
  and the API retrieves name matches.

-Allow users to add photos of card artwork.

-Social aspect. Allow users to add their friends on the app and compare 
  collections, deck lists, maybe even propose trades, etc.
